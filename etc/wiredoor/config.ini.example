[daemon]
;Enable daemon mode to run 'wiredoor status --health --watch 10' as a systemd service.
;This ensures the node stays connected automatically across system reboots and network interruptions.
;
;When enabled, Wiredoor runs in the background and:
;  - Automatically connects on boot using saved configuration
;  - Re-establishes the VPN if the tunnel is dropped
;  - Syncs with the Wiredoor server and responds to remote connect/disconnect commands
;
;This allows node connectivity to be controlled directly from the Wiredoor Server UI.
;Useful for IoT, edge systems, or unattended environments.
